    <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is a way of collaborating on code with a partner where traditionally one assumes the role of coding and one assumes the role of navigating the course of the problem at hand.</p>
    <h2>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h2>
        <p>Pair Programming is very important in that each member of the pair learns from one another. PP helps code become more precise, and is a good introduction to the collaborative effort of the coding workforce.</p>
    <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
        <p>In the traditional sense, the driver is the coder and the navigator is the guide. However, separating the two roles is not always the best, and at times combining the two is even better.</p>


      <h2> Personal Reflection</h2>

       <p>Pairing for GPS 1.2 was different but just as successful as 1.2. This time the roles of navigator and driver were more fluid and we actively took turns writing the code throughout the entire process.</p>

        <p>I actually thought this process worked better for me. Being able to be hands on all the time was awesome and also very effective as long as we were able to communicate well what we were editing or thinking.</p>

        <p>I thought we both had a good handle of the competencies required for the challenge. I still have to memorize the full extent of the syntax we have learned but already know most of what can be done so it's easy to quickly find some syntax where it may be missing. I'm sure with time the rest of those gaps will be filled.</p>
