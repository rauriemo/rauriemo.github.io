  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>Feb. 21, 2015 </h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I must say stereotype threat is an entirely new concept to me but it seems to have a lot to do with your expectations for what is associated with a group your are considered a part of. When people see themselves as part of a group with negative associations attached to it, they fear falling into those associations, and consequently actually have a higher chance of falling in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps because I was never really prone to stereotype, my motivations were always intrinsic, and my belief that I could achieve anything I set my mind to was firm, I have been more immune to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also doesn't make sense to me, logically, that I should be any specific way just because I am considered part of a group. I always saw myself as my own person, a citizen of the world, and never really understood why standardized tests would want to divide us in groups, or really what group I was in to be honest. Latino? Hispanic? White/Caucasian?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is good to know that this can affect people, and that perhaps some people need some motivation and encouragement. Instead of making the environment more welcoming, I think the path is in making the person feel more welcome in the environment. Take their head out of the framework of the group, and see themselves as an individual; get them to believe in themselves.
