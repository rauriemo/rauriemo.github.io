  <h2>Javascript Objects Vs. Ruby Hashes</h2>
  <h4>Feb. 26, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Often times when working with software we will find a need to record an ordered list of data.
      Arrays and Hashes are similar structures which allow us to keep such strings of data.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ruby an array and a hash differ in that an array uses numbers as keys to refer to each element in the collection where a hash is an array that uses subjective values as the keys.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Javascript keys are called properties and arrays by default have numbers as their property names much like an array in ruby would have numbers as its keys. Instead of a hash however Javascript uses objects which have variable property names which can be defined or created.
    </p>

    <p>
      The same way a class in ruby would define a set of functions that go together, what an object in Javascript attempts to do is define a set of properties that go together. A bicicle class might have the functions ride, and getOnOff an object bicicle might have the properties color, weight, wheels, etc... These two strategies make it a lot easier to connect software to the real world and to practical uses.
