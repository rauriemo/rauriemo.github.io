    <p>
      The ruby class above represents a person. As you can see it takes a name at initialization. Every person has an age, and therefore i defined the @age instance variable at the beginning. I used the @ symbol to tell the program that the methods inside this class also have access to this variable. if i were to have used two @@ then it could be accessed by methods outside of the class. I then have two instance methods defined to return this variable and to modify its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see however I did not implement similar methods for address and name. The reason for this is that attr_accessor :var_name is equivalent to having a get and set method for that variable. Instead of using accessor you can also use attr_reader if you want to be able to return the variable and attr_writter if you only want to be able to modify its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use classes to group our code together in logical subcategories. Every time I access a variable related to person, I want to be dealing with that class and therefore all the methods should be contained within it also.
