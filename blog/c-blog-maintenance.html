      The experience of working on my personal website is frustrating and rewarding. It can sometimes feel like a bit of a rabbit hole when changing one element means having to copy the change to every page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting feedback was very worthwhile. I got some great ideas of things to implement from my brother and a friend. So far I only implemented the change of the links being aplied to the entire block vs only on the text box. This has been a significant improvement in useability.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next changes are making the site more mobile friendly by allowing the page to slide left right up and down to the links. Since I have only 4 categories linked from the index this would work really well. I also want to implement Jeckyll so as to have my nav bar not interfere so much when I change something on one page. I have not yet gotten it to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent a lot of time this week on my site and decided it was best to take a break after 2 days working solely on this. I will revisit it once the rest of this week's material is done.
