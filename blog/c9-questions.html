      As obvious as it may seem there are actually best practices associated with how to ask questions on websites such as Stack Overflow. The golden rule though is simply: imagine you are the one trying to answer it. The question should be formulated simply and succintly and include several things that increase the liklihood someone will stop to answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One aspect which highly contributes to the likelihood that your question will be asnwered is how well your title is formulated. It should ideally be a question that describes very specifically what your doubt is. Doing your due dilligence and showing others that you have already attempted to find solutions for your issue online also increases the liklihood that you will get an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also very important to provide context for your problem. This includes information regarding language version, platform version, operating system, and any other relevant software or specific constraints. This ensures that the solutions provided will be tailoored for your exact needs. It is also imnportant to be very clear about what exactly is the "return" you are looking for. What exactly do you need fixed.A good way to help others in helping you is to provide code samples from your program that illustrate the error you are trying to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all remember to be kind, be polite and be thankful to those who are giving you some of their time to help you. Remember also to select the best answer for your question when it is given. This way you pass the knowledge on so that those who have the same doubt as you in the future may quickly know what the solution was.
