  <h2>Values</h2>
  <h4>Feb. 26, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      When I think of the times in my life that I have been the happiest and felt the most satisfied the values that come to mind are love, independence, accomplishment, activism,  creativity, excitement, intellectual and personal growth, feeling that I trully had enrooted some knowledge and wisdom into my brain, honesty, finding courage, finding inner peace, facing and solving challenges, helping others, helping society, helping the community, and feeling awe at what can be achieved by humans everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure I can answer as to whether I live up to all of these values; most of my values above are things you find, but I am most definetly always looking to put myself in situations where I can find them. In life you can't always be solving puzzles, or always be creative, or always be helping people, or always be finding personal and intellectual growth; its about balancing your time to fit all of the things that matter to you into your life. The important thing is to try to be corageous enough to always keep looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last topic someone asked me for advice on was for feedback on an app idea. I suppose my intellectual growth has often been in the realm of technology and I am honest to a fault so I would be a good person to provide that feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not believe I have ever felt stereotype threat, maybe because most of my values are about internal growth and do not care about external status. I don't know what the stereotypes for brazilians are, maybe if I was a politician I'd be afraid of being seen as corrupt, but other than that I'm kind of free to be myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am lucky that acquiring knowledge (especially when it involves technology, math and requires creativity) is one of the things that makes me the happiest in life. Therefore I don't expect to be having many down days at DBC, however if I do it would probably be from lack of balance and as such I should remain mindful of the other things that are important to me.
