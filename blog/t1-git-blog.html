        Git and GitHub are powerful tools that allow for collaboration in software design. Git is a program that saves a separate snapshot each time you hit save. Instead of only having a final draft saved it has a copy of every draft along the way.

        There are three stages to the git process. Every time a file is changed it gets flagged. You can see which files have been chaged by entering the - git status - command in your terminal. To add flagged files to the stage, those that are ready to be committed, you enter the command - git add fileName. Finally you committ an oficial save of your project that will contain the changed files by entering the command - git commit -v.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several benefits that come with this process. For example, by storing every version you allow a devloper to restore previous working versions in case he adds a bug accidently to the code. By comparing the changes in the two it also allows you to identify where these bugs may lie. Since this is backed up for the history of the project it also allows you to see who committed changes in the past in case you need to resolve a doubt you may be having with the code they added.

       GitHub is an online platform where people can collaborate on git projects over the web. It allows you to forward your changes to a remote repository where you may be collaborating with a group of people.
