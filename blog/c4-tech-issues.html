  <h2>Tech Problems: The Concurrent Need for Open Source and Monetization</h2>
  <h4>Today's Date</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      If you could imagine a world where all children learn to code from a young age and where most current technologies are open source, where the code was visible and open to modification, we can easily see how the pace of technological advancement and the level of overall enjoyment in technology usage would increase sharply. Technology and software would no longer be a standardized software package shipped and marketed to millions. When all technology is open source, and when all are equipped to understand the tools available to them then we can shape these tools to best fit us, and reclaim our identity as individuals with individual and distinct needs for technology. In freely sharing ideas we also promote new innovation, allowing others to see further by stepping on the shoulders of giants before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem arises from the fact that it is normal for people and businesses to want to make a profit and when your profit comes from the execution of said software, releasing it for free as open source doesn't make much economic sense. It would also be a disincentive to technological growth and innovation if inventors and collaborators had no claim over their software and no way to monetize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding a balance here is difficult. At what point is a company protecting its i.p. in search of monetization and at what point is it preventing innovation. Licenses have done a good job in starting to pave the way for open source. By establishing rules and regulations on what can be done with open source code you can at least create a regulated market. If I release my code open source stating it must only be used for non profit ends then I can seek justice from those who violate this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that in the same way that the bit coin is recorded as a chain of commits so should code collaborations be recorded. In trees and branches of collaborators, each down the line having to obey the licensing of the above. Github is an online platform that helps alot towards this end. I can see complications though from excessive bureacracy of having to check every previous collaborators demands on their code. It might be wise to have originators also able to determine the licenses of child softwares.
    </p>
    <p>
      One platform that I think would benefit the world of open source is a not for profit kickstarter that backs desired softwares. It works like a reverse auction so the bids start coming in for a desired program, as soon as a qualified engineer is willing to accept the current total he takes the project and collects the fee upon delivery. Once delivered this code is open source. Those who paid should accept having paid additional as they are the originators and ones with the greatest need for it. Now that it is open source collaborators will also improve on this code which also benefits the early adopters. Collaborators can promote their own versions with new functions, and people can also request new auctions for desired extensions to the code. Eventually all the code starts becoming open source. Old solutions will get reapplied and the knowledge will start becoming more communal. Monetization will be more about how service is attached to a software, rather than on how it was written.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times monetization and open source in tech seem like polar ends of a spectrum, but in reality they can exist side by side; implementing their coexistence however can be tricky. Looking at our past, we as a species have not always made the best decision when confronted with the greater good vs. greed. This time however the numbers may be on our side, the internet gives everyone an equal voice. The benefits of open source are too big to ignore and many have seen this. Information is attainable, and for as long as it is attainable there will be people getting it and sharing it. The path of least resistance doesn't lie in finding ways to keep software more closed and restrictive, it lies in finding ways to allow it to be fully open source, get there as fast as possible, and all while maintaining a viable revenue model for its creators and collaborators.
