  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <h4>Mar. 8, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I must admit I'm the kind of person that usually avoids conflict. I tend to internalize other people's emotions and therefore conflict is complicated because everyone has to come out feeling good for me to come out feeling good. At worst I agree to disagree with someone and we don't actually enter a conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do have a lasting memory of conflict that I can't really shake. I've only been sent to detention once in my life and it was in the 2nd grade. I was standing in line for something, I don't recall what exactly, could have been anything, when this girl cut in front of me. I have always been about justice and fairness and when she wouldn't move I jumped back in front of her to my original spot. She started crying and we both got sent to the principle's office. It just so happens that she was the principal's daughter and my word didn't count for much that day. I got sent to detention for the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt extremely angry at the injustice; I had done nothing wrong. To this day injustice and abuse of power are the things that give me the most anger. Most of this anger now being directed at Brazilian politicians. That day also happened to be Easter and there was a party planned in class that afternoon which I had to miss. I also happened to be the one in charge of bringing all the food for the party. I couldn't bare the thought of the principle's daughter eating all the food I had brought while I sat there in detention because of her; so I took it all to detention with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could go back I would change a few things. I probably would have tried to reason with her but all else failing I would have probably had to leave it be; taking it to the principal obviously wouldn't have worked. I also felt really guilty after for having taken the party away from people who had done nothing wrong to me and as such looking back I would have felt better leaving the party be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned through this experience that there are things in the world that are out of our control and that aren't fair. I also learned that all the anger was useless in achieving change; the only thing anger led me to was guilt for having ruined the party. For things to change there has to be more transparency so that power is not simply "had" by those in positions of authority but rather earned with every single action.
