  <h2>Thinking Style and Learning</h2>

      When I took the Gregorc thinking test I got almost a perfect score for both Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random. I identified with the description of what both categoried represented. I do indeed like to experiment to find answers, take risks, use my intuition, solve problems independantly, have my point be heard, analyze situations before acting, and apply logic to find solutions to problems. It seemed a little odd that I was at the same time sequential and random, and also abstract and concrete; but I have always been a man of very diverse interests, being extremely left and right brained.
    </p>

      What was interesting to me was how these styles of thinking learn best. One thing evident in both and that I already knew is that I learn best when able to experiment alone. I have always known myself to be very competitive but never looked at this as a tool to improve my learning process. One thing that I liked seeing was the use of trial and error as a valid approach to learning. When I was very young I remember very well teaching myself mathematics through trial and error. Trial and error helps me understand the logic of problems and kind of step inside them as they iterate a few times. I remember being yelled at by my teacher who said this was not a valid way to learn. Even in programming trial and error seems to be the best way for me to learn.

      I think there are definite benefits to being both very logical and very creative/intuitive. Programming may seem like a very logical thing to learn (and it is indeed a very logical system) but I think it also takes a lot of creativity to be great at.

      The biggest struggle for me so far has been the workload. I joined the course late and have been doing a weeks worth of work every 3-4 days so far. Starting tomorrow I will be caught up and should be able to handle it perfectly. It has also been difficult for me not to monopolize pairing sessions. Usually when I get the picture of a solution in my head its difficult for me to stop coding until its out "on paper". I have been making a conscious effort to pause and ask for input.

      While it is good to reflect and understand where you stand in terms of natural learning styles it is perhaps even more important to understand that these natural tendencies are not set in stone. I am a big supporter of the growth mindset that believes that our intellectual capabilities can change and improve over time; that our brain is a muscle to be worked. While I know that I have a tough time working with other people it doesn't mean that I'm not gonna push myself to work with other people and get better at it. Part of this is understanding my limitations and owning them. One example is having a tough time remembering people's names. I used to avoid contact with people whose names I couldn't remember when now I find that theres no problem in telling them "hey, sorry, I remember you from 'x' place and so and so, but I have a tough time remembering names, do you mind telling me your name again?" When you are honest about your limitations it becomes easier to deal with them.
