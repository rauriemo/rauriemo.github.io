      <li>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>
      <li>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</li>
      <li>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Pairing with others so far has been both difficult and enlightening. As a rule of thumb pairing on a challenge makes it take much, much longer and as a consequence can often get frustrating. Wrapping your head around a problem is difficult enough without having to explain it or discuss it. At the same time this discussion can and has often led me to learn new tools from my partners.

      I particularly enjoy the talk before we start tackling a problem when we are just going through the steps and discussing what tools we will probably want to deploy for each step.

      As I have not yet received any feedback I cannot answer the second half of this challenge. Most likely this is because I joined the course a few weeks late.

      So far I am not a big fan of the approach, especially while we are still all spread out in different cities. I work a lot better/faster alone. While we can't sit next to each other and watch the other person writing the code I would prefer working alone.
