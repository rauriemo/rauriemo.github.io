      From what I have heard and based on this <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">video</a> the DBC experience seems to be an open journey in beginning life as a developer. In the video above is described the kitchen vs. table metaphor where most people are influenced to expect a consumer packaged product when they pay for something (like ordering off the menu in a restaurant), where this experience is much more of a kitchen where we all bring our tools to the table and see what we can make.

      I like the fact that this learning experience can be customized towards your curiosities or specific coding needs and look forward to using the human capital available at Dev Bootcamp =)

<p>
      I strongly believe that access to the global knowledge we have accumulated should be an inalienable right and I like this hacker mentality of sharing our tools and learning as a collective. So far I have already learned several tools that I have been curious to pick up.

      I was aware that I was entering a new type of learning experience but still had expectations that it would fall under traditional teaching styles. Traditional schooling in my opinion is not well suited to answer all our learning needs. It may work well on an average but many different types of learners require more customized solutions. I am excited to participate in this kind of learning environment
